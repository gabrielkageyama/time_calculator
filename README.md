Logic behind a Time Calculator

This is a Project iniciated in university that i'm implementating with new features.

It is built with C++ but i plan to re-code it in C# since i know the stack better.

To use the program, just run it and navigate through the interactive menu.

FEATURES: 
- addition and subtraction;
- equality comparison;
- formatation;
- magnitude comparison.

FEATURES TO ADD:
- frontend development;
- more operations.

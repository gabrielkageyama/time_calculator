Logic behind a Time Calculator

This is a Project iniciated in university that i'm implementating with new features.

It is built with C++ but i plan to re-code it in C# since i know the stack better.

FEATURES: 
- Sum two given times;
- Compare equality of two given times;
- format given time in 24h:60m:60s
-
